Started as a personal link-in-bio page using Vercel Edge Config for easy content updates without redeploying. The edge-based approach made managing links effortless—just update the config and changes go live instantly.

After seeing how well it worked, I evolved it into a multi-tenant platform so others could benefit from the same simple workflow. Each user gets their own namespace while sharing the same lightweight infrastructure.
